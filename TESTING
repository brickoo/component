About
-----
* BrickOO has been developed using PHPUnit.
* The test suites assure the functionality of the framework.
* All test suites must pass and should not contain any skipped test cases.
* The test suites must cover all classes provided by BrickOO.
* The test suites can be found in the Tests folder, which rely on the same structure as the framework.


Requirements
------------
* BrickOO requires PHPUnit 3.6 or any later version for testing.


Installation
------------
* The PHPUnit documentation can be found here:
  http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.6/en/installation.html


Testing BrickOO
---------------
* On GNU/Linux you just run phpunit, on Windows you may need to run phpunit.bat within your PHP folder.
* Testing the framework can be done by running this line:
  phpunit -c /path/to/brickoo/Tests/phpunit.xml path/to/brickoo/Tests
* The HMTL code coverage can be created by running this line:
  phpunit -c /path/to/BrickOO/Tests/phpunit.xml --coverage-html /path/to/your/coverage/folder /path/to/BrickOO/Tests
* You can also just test one test suite if you like, example:
  phpunit -c /path/to/brickoo/Tests/phpunit.xml path/to/brickoo/Tests/Library/Core/BrickooTest.php


Testing using PTI in Eclipse
----------------------------
* Select under Debug the print output to console mode.
* Select the BrickOO/Tests/bootstrap.php file as bootstrap file.
